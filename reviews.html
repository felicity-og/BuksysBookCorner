Soulmate Equation… watched a booktok and the reviewer said <strong>"… there's nothing like a single mom being taken care of" </strong> and I was sold! That statement hit deep.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>
A story about single motherhood, community, family, love, science (the nerd in me loved this), the probability of finding your <strong> <em>person</em></strong>. I'm usually not a fan of slow- burns but I completely did not mind it. I was hooked from the first chapter. I have to say I laughed out loud so many times because Jess is hilarious; the humour she brought to book was refreshing. 
	</p>
	<p>
The storytelling was <strong>*insert chef's kiss*</strong>. The struggles of being  a single mom sometimes weighed her down but she had a great support system who always showed up for her. A community that she was ever grateful for. She never let herself want for more especially in the romance department because she felt it was selfish to her kid. But when River came along she couldn’t deny the want, how it felt to be wanted. Jess and River's story did not start so smoothly but it blossomed into something beautiful. It took some time for River's real character to show up but when it did ouuuu. He was <strong>THERE</strong> for Jess which came as a surprise to her and almost had her running for the hills lol. River's kindness and affection did not go unnoticed and his attention to her and her close knit family made her heart soar. 
	</p>
	<p>
The scientific approach to the start of their relationship was an added bonus and I enjoyed the elements of statistics and the probability that their compatibility made them soulmates.The most heart-warming aspect of this was Jess finally being taken care of; after years of solely focusing on Juno, who was her whole world; she got to experience a different type of love and devotion. She chose to be vulnerable, take a risk and let love lead instead of logic… and River made it all worth it.
