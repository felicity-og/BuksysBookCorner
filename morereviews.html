Usually it takes some time for me to fully fall in love with a book boyfriend but with Daniel Grant, it came so easily. From the first few chapters, you get an idea of the kind of human he is, kind, humble and someone that reignites your faith in mankind ( I might be exaggerating but if you've read it, tell me you understand!!). 
	</p>
	<p>
I relate a lot of Daniel's traits to my mum because they are so similar; selfless to a fault, they are everything to everyone not leaving much for themselves, their dreams, aspirationsâ€¦ I digress lol
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>
A story about that 'one of a kind' love, the unspoken burden put on children, classism, that 'family is found' kind of friendship, and the deep rooted effects sometimes unseen, unspoken; of abuse.
	</p>
	<p>
I'll start with the 'one of a kind' loveâ€¦ Alexis didnâ€™t know what it was like to be loved till she was loved wholly by Daniel. She was not accustomed to the sacrificial love that Daniel made her feel time and time again; she hadn't seen it in her parents, or felt it in her relationship with them nor had she been loved like that in the past . It was a strange but welcome feeling. And she thought she could deny herself of it, convincing herself that she could walk away from it but once you experience that kind of love; it changes you, alters you forever.
	</p>
	<p>
The most thought provoking theme in this book for me was how much classism is present in this world and how it robs us of experiencing the beautiful nature of mankind. We judge without any basis, we lack the compassion to treat each other equally and unknowingly miss out on special people who could have changed our lives even just for a minute;  for Alexis, stepping into Wakan made her realize the sort of life she lived, the way her 'class' treated the 'others' of society and that kind of awareness can only be experienced. That shift in perspective is simply a reminder that differences shouldnâ€™t equate division rather be the driving force of togetherness.
	</p>
	<p>
Lastly; 'sometimes family is found'â€¦ the depiction of this was highly represented in this book; Daniel and basically the whole town of Wakan, Alexis and Bri. It was so beautiful to see Bri remind Alexis of her worth even when her own family made her feel less than, when Bri stood up for her countless times when the people she called friends didn't. When Doug showed up cause  Daniel needed him, when Wakan showed up for Hannah and many other instances. It warmed my heart because truly; friends are your chosen family.
	</p>

This book was heartfelt, brilliant, historical all kinds of spectacular ( see I'm trying, haven't said beautiful ðŸ¤­). Too many quotes stuck with me while reading but i'll drop these two which I relate to the most. </p>
	<ul class="a">
<li><b><i>"sometimes when the wake up call is big enough, you do in fact wake up.</i></b></li>
<li><b><i>"Grace costs you nothing"</i></b></li>
