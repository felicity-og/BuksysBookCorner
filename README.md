##Buksy's Book Corner
Hello!
This was a personal project I carried out while advancing my skills in web development/ design. 
It was more of a passion project as I recently decided to open a bookstagram (instagram account for all things books:))
It was the most fun I had had while programming in a long time and I learnt alot about myself, I am hoping to host the 
website soon, make new cool changes and have it as my official book blog site.

Below is a snapshot of one of my favorite pages
